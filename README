This is a simple raytracer.  

The primary purpose for this project is to be written for the sake of writing.
The intent is to implement all logic directly related to tracing and 
postprocessing from the ground up.


BUILDING

Beyond the standdard gcc toolset, which should be a given, you will require
the following to build and run this project:

	libqt4-dev
	qt4-dev-tools
	libjsoncpp

libjsoncpp source can be found in ./lib; you will need to build it, install
its includes in the include path, and install the .so it produces somewhere
in the linker path.

libjsoncpp should also be available at http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/
